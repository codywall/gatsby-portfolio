    <h4>Frontend Web Development</h4>
    <p>
      I use modern technologies to build fast and functional websites and applications. I have
      professional experience developing responsive websites and applications with JavaScript,
      React, HTML/CSS, NodeJS, GatsbyJS and Git.

    <h4>User Interface Design</h4>
    <p>
      A strong background in UI/UX design guides my development process and allows me to view the
