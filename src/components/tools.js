    <h3>Frontend Web Development</h3>
    <p>
      I use modern technologies to build fast, functional websites. I have professional experience
      developing responsive websites and applications with JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, GatsbyJS and
      Git.
    </p>
    <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
    <p>
      A strong background in UI/UX design guides my development process and allows me to view the
      applications I am creating from the perspective of the user.
