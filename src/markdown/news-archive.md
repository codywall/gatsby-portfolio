title: News Archive
summary: The CSUMB News Archive is a React web application which allows campus staff to view and search for archived news articles for Cal State University, Monterey Bay. The implementation of this application allows unneeded news stories to be removed from the campus website database while keeping them for reference. This project saved the University from paying unnecessary database hosting costs, as it is a no cost solution.
