title: CSUMB Website
summary: As the primary Web Developer at CSU Monterey Bay, I work alongside a pair of UX designers, and together we are responsible for the entire campus website across all departments. We collaborate with department leaders to transform their business needs from mockups into web applications, with a strong focus on usability and accessibility. The campus website is an open source static React site, built with GatsbyJS.
