title: My Personal Portfolio
summary: In 2019, I converted my personal portfolio from an HTML/SCSS site to a React app using Styled Components. As this was my first React project, the end result was less than ideal. I recently went back into my portfolio and refactored everything, using components more efficiently, stripping tons of lines of CSS, and getting data from markdown files using GraphQL rather than JSON objects. It is always a work in progress, but it is nice to see how much cleaner the code I am writing now is.

This will be a summary of how I built my portfolio.
